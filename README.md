We used the tools like Burp Suit,PDB,Nmap,Netcat

**BurpSuit**:
A powerful cybersecurity tool for evaluating the security of online applications is called Burp Suite. It has a scanner for automated vulnerability discovery, a spider for mapping application architecture, and a proxy for intercepting and altering HTTP/S traffic. Its intrusion detection technology uses automated assaults to find security flaws like XSS and SQL injection. For testing purposes, the repeater permits manual modification and resending of HTTP requests. Token and session identifier randomness is evaluated by the sequencer. A decoder aids in the decoding of different encoding systems. A comparer facilitates the identification of variations in replies or data. Burp Suite is a complete web application security testing tool that is popular among developers and security experts alike.

**PDB(Python Debugger)**:
Incorporate the PDB module into your Python script by importing it.
Place pdb.set_trace() where you wish to interrupt the execution to create a breakpoint.
Run Script: This will cause your Python script to stop at the breakpoint.
Employ the Debugger Commands: Make use of commands such as h (help), p (print), q (quit), l (list), c (continue), and n (next).
Give Up Debugging: When debugging is finished, use q to exit the debugger.

**Nmap**:
Nmap is an open-source program that may be used to discover hosts, services, and operating systems for network research and security audits.
It can identify service versions, check for open ports, and automate interactions with scripts.
Nmap is used by network administrators for inventory and monitoring, and by security experts to identify vulnerabilities.
Unauthorized scanning, on the other hand, is prohibited and immoral, and requires the right authorizations to be used.
Nmap is an effective tool for both offensive and defensive network security procedures overall.

**Netcat(NC)**:
One well-known command-line utility for networking is Netcat, or NC.
Often referred to as the "Swiss Army knife" of networking, it was created in 1995.
When it comes to file transfers, port scanning, and remote shell access, Netcat is an excellent tool.
But because it isn't encrypted, there are security dangers, so use it with caution.
Leveraging its power successfully requires an understanding of its capabilities.
